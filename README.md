We started this project during **summer 2014**.

On **June 4, 2016**, Apple authorized the external testing [using TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/). We got a lot of great feedback and this enabled us to improve the game a lot.

First release on **August 17, 2016** on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/edgar-explorer-platform-game/id1100015560&l=en). We were very bad at marketing the game (no advertising / blog posts / press news), but a good ranking helped us to get about 1000 downloads within two months (see our [download statistics](https://github.com/PolipGames/Edgar/blob/master/App_Store/itunes_connect_downloads.csv)).

Unexpected download peak two years later (3000 installs in a few weeks).

**February 2019**: a Swiss music producer started creating sounds and a new music -- work in progress.

All source files are in **[Maze Escape](Maze%20Escape)**. This folder's [README](Maze%20Escape/README.md) contains more informations about the code.

Three great, much more advanced FOSS iPhone games we love:

* 2048 (MIT) https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048

* Dungeon Story (MIT) https://github.com/pdeligia/dungeonstory-ios

* Puzzles (MIT) https://github.com/ghewgill/puzzles

We are looking for other free/libre iOS games or game makers. Any help is appreciated.
